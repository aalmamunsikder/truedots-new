I would like to build the website for now with latest Next.js version.
for the backend we will use Supabase and we will have a separated Admin Panel to manage the website.

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY SNAPSHOT

trueDOTS/TRUEdots is a new dating/matchmaking solution that offers dating and matchmaking services to individuals globally, regardless of race, religion, or sexual orientation.
 
The Idea:
The concept is borne out of the idea that every connection, every entity (person or place) is represented by a dot on the digital map, and it takes at least two dots to make a meaningful connection. And for that connection to be meaningful, it must be TRUE!
 
Branding:
Logo Title: TRUEdots / trueDOTS
Slogan: Meaningful Connections
Specific Colors: Deep Purple / Magenta and main colors
 
2. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

trueDOTS will be developed and deployed as a mobile application for devices running iOS/iPadOS as well as Android. It will also be available on the web via a responsive browser.
